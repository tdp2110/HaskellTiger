I used Simon Marlow's lexer with very small modifications (https://github.com/simonmar/alex/master/examples/tiger.x)

I've also benefitted from prikhi's ML implementation:
     https://github.com/prikhi/modern-compiler-implementation-ml/
And the following Haskell implementations:
    https://github.com/svenpanne/tiger/
