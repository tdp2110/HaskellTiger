# HaskellTiger
Andrew Appel's _Modern Compiler Implementation in ML_, implemented in Haskell

Learning Haskell, while working through compiler book

I have no idea what I'm doing :clown_face:

Currently targeting only MacOS on x86_64.
Linux System V x86_86 wouldn't be much of a change, nor would 64 bit Windows.

## Remaining pieces:

1. ~~Implement register allocation~~ (started Dec 2019, finished Feb 2020)
2. Hook everything up
3. Test for real, and fix the bugs! ☜(⌒▽⌒)☞
4. Implement real GC.
5. Abstract frame to different OS: AMD64 Linux, 64-bit Windows (why not), ARM something ʘ‿ʘ
